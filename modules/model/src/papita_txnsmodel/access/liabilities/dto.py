"""Liabilities DTO module for the Papita Transactions system.

This module defines the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for liability entities in the system.
It provides validation and data structures for different types of liabilities, including
general liabilities, bank credit liabilities, and credit card liabilities. These DTOs
ensure data integrity when transferring liability data between different layers of the
application.

Classes:
    LiabilityAccountsDTO: Base DTO for all liability accounts.
    ExtendedLiabilityAccountsDTO: Base DTO for specialized liability accounts.
    BankCreditLiabilityAccountsDTO: DTO for bank credit liability accounts.
    CreditCardLiabilityAccountsDTO: DTO for credit card liability accounts.
