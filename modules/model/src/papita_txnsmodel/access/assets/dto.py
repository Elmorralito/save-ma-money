"""Assets DTO module for the Papita Transactions system.

This module defines the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for asset entities in the system.
It provides validation and data structures for different types of assets, including
general assets, banking assets, real estate assets, and trading assets. These DTOs
ensure data integrity when transferring asset data between different layers of the
application.

Classes:
    AssetAccountsDTO: Base DTO for all asset accounts.
    ExtendedAssetAccountsDTO: Base DTO for specialized asset accounts.
    FinancedAssetAccountsDTO: DTO for assets that are partially or fully financed.
    BankingAssetAccountsDTO: DTO for banking-related asset accounts.
    RealEstateAssetAccountsDTO: DTO for real estate asset accounts.
    TradingAssetAccountsDTO: DTO for trading and investment asset accounts.
