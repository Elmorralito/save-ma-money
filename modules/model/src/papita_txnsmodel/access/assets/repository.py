"""Assets repository module for the Papita Transactions system.

This module defines the repository classes for asset entities in the system.
It provides database access operations specific to assets, extending the base
repository functionality with asset-specific implementations.

Classes:
    AssetAccountsRepository: Repository for general asset account operations.
    ExtendedAssetAccountsRepository: Repository for specialized asset account operations.
    FinancedAssetAccountsRepository: Repository for financed asset account operations.
